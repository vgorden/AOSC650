# AOSC650
This repository contains my final project for the University of Maryland's AOSC 650 course: Neural Networks for the Physical Sciences. This work would not be possible without the assistance of Dr. Maria Molina and the support provided by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
